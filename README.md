# Tensorflow-Convulutional-Neural-Network
A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrate the classification abilities of Tensoflow Convolutional Neural Network. This project was meant for classifying aircraft types using Tensorflow. Later builds of this project will allow for real-time classification using OpenCV.
