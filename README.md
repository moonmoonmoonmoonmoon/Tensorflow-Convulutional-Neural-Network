# Tensorflow-Convulutional-Neural-Network
A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrate the classification abilities of Tensoflow Convolutional Neural Network. This project was meant for classifying aircraft types using Tensorflow. Later builds of this project will allow for real-time classification using OpenCV.

- March 25th, 2022: First upload of this project on Github. The program needs a number of prerequisites to be installed for Python in order to work properly: Tensorflow, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Pickle, NumPy, and categorized images of aircrafts.
